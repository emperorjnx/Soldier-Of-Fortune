# Soldier-Of-Fortune


This repository contains my idea for an interactive text based game.
The character of my game is basically a soldier who gets caught by the enemy , Now his major goal is to escape. 
The game is interactive ,so the character acts according to the users commands.
A help dialog box is printed which helps the user familirize with the controls of the game.
The game may have some parts where the user would have to enter his next command very quickly.
Enjoy building and playing the game!!

Read the scenario file for the story and how the story gets executed.
Note: All coding is done using python.

Note:
You need opencv installed to run this game
anaconda installation
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
