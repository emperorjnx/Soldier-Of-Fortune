#Preface
Max is a soldier for the allied forces, At the war in the battlefield of Berlin,
He was mortally wounded in the battlefield and lost his consciousness. The allied army retreats.
He is presumed dead by his team and is left to dead on the battlefield. 
When he regains consciousness ,He is finds himself on the hospital bed. 
But to his dismay it was the enemy basecamp, the head of the nazi bootcamp saved him thinking he was some 
commanding officer of the allied forces and thought of extracting intel from him once max regained his 
conscious.

#Intro
Max: Where am I?
Nurse: came down your safe( in a german english accent)
Max: Who are you? Why do you speak funny?
Nurse: Me, speaking funny!! Why sir it is you who is the odd one out here.
	you are in the nazi bootcamp set up here in berlin.

(Max quickly understood what was going on ,But before he could react he was knocked out and finds himself in an old room)

#The story begins
The general: Wake up, sleep is not a luxury which you can find here.
Max: Who are you?
(Wacks Max using a wip)
The general: Know who is above you, you dirty insect.
		i made sure the nurse saved you just enough so that you could regain your senses.
		Now tell me what you Stupid people where up to at Berlin?
		Why did you attack here at all time, why not somewhere at the coast!!
Max: I would kill myself!!, before i betray my country.

( Before the general could say anything a sub-lieutanant comes and whispers something)

The general: Fine i'll be on my way make sure you keep an eye on him.

(the player takes over Max's character from now, He has to figure out a way to escape the bootcamp
and reach out to his allies)
